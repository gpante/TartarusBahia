  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Our three heroes walk down the curved path towards Turtle Bay with aspirations of Turtle Fest in their minds. Torryn, the hotheaded blue dragonborn meets up with Lrrr, a weathered dwarf seeking new vigor as well as Azura, a mysterious drow. 
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Torryn, known from his clan as the local idiot, was ironically the only one of our heroes that had any knowledge of turtles. Lrrr and Azura, while goodhearted in nature, had no knowledge but great curiosity.
  </div><br>

  <div class ="hideme">
    As they progress down the path, a rustle in the bushes grab their attention. Before they can investigate, an arrow shoots past Torrynâ€™s face and the chase is on. They pursue down the path until they are met with a translucent copper-toned cube, squelching in their path. 
  </div><br>

  <div class ="hideme">
    Being seasoned explorers capable of holding their own, they take charge against the unknown combatant. Azure fires a crossbow bolt and Lrrr moves in to strike with his longsword. Their deft strikes and careful aim are met with a viscous material that take their attacks in stride. Seeking to finish the slime, Torryn readies himself to unleash his breath weapon. A steadied stance, a deepened inhale. Electricity arcs across his jaws as lightning itself rips savagely through the air.
  </div><br>

  <div class ="hideme">
    Upon impact, the Ochre Slime is unaffected, and perhaps even bolstered by the attack. A moment passes as the slime shudders violently until it splits into two halves, each one capable of action. It seems as though matters have been made worse for our heroes. 
  </div><br>

  <div class ="hideme">
    Learning from their mistakes, the three have adopted new styles of attack. Relying mostly on Azura's strong magic, they are able to subdue the slime before too much damage has been caused to themselves. 
  </div><br>

  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Catching their breath and returning to their pursuit, our heroes have regained status quo on the trail towards Turtle Bay. Bolstered by Torryn's tales of magnificent creatures and the revelrous festivities of Turtle Fest, the remaining two are emblazoned with new energy. Searching for clues, Lrrr finds his own footprints, mistaking them for the runaway culprit.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="lrrr" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    They're right on top of us!
  </div></div></div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Luckily, they will need this newfound excitement as they are suddenly attacked by a band of goblins looking for a new set of victims. Dodging an incoming arrow, Azura tries to make peace with the goblins. Her exclamations fall on deaf ears as they ready another volley of arrows until she speaks again. This time, in undercommon.
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="azura" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    We do not want to harm you, we seek peace!
  </div></div></div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    These goblins are startled and with a visible shock in their faces, they respond. A half-woven conversation ensues with Azura trying to grasp at an attempt to dissuade conflict. However, these goblins were not to be suade. In time, they had enough and lost their patience. Letting loose another arrow, the tension broke and combat followed suit. 
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes make quick work of the few ground infantry as Azura picks off the pair of goblins in the trees peppering them with arrows. As their numbers dwindled, a fear appeared in the lone goblin's cowardly eyes and a hunting horn in one of his trembling hands. Before our heroes could reach the alerter, it was already too late. The alarm had been sound and reinforcements were sure to arrive shortly. 
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    As Lrrr is about to impale the sole goblin, a hefty man lands with precision and practice onto the goblin, instantly dispatching it. A look of concern followed by a quick glance around is quickly replaced with a friendly smile and an outstretched hand. In his other massive hand, shaped as a clenched fist, a veritable collection of unmoving goblins. Presumably the reinforcements. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="varum" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    Hello! My name is Varum, how can I be of assistance?
  </div></div></div>
  
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    While walking with this man the group learns more of Varum. A persistent smile rest peacefully below his thick moustache, but the man's bald head gave way to a gleaming disposition of concern for his fellow adventurers. We learn that this strapping man is seen as a protector around this area, especially so during Turtle Fest when many people come from all over to partake in games, food, and of course: the Blessing of the Tortle. Being familiar with these woods, Varum takes the lead in showing the rest of our group their way into town. His jostling pack and clinking buckles provides a soft metronome for our heroes to walk to as they take in the scenery in peace for the first time.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Sunlight broke through the leafy canopy in disrupted rays as the worn path brought up dust and dirt beneath their feet. Glancing to the left would occasionally bring glimpses of the further reaches of the bay itself, whereas the right led to deeper expanses of forested woods. 
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Before long, the curving path led them to the doorstep of Turtle Bay, a quaint seaside village that's prized for it's unique turtle population. To north of town, the titular bay lay scattered with a myriad of turtles and their young. To the south, a lively fishing district that supplied the village with food and exports. Within the center were the houses and markets that lended to the village's homestyle appeal. Along the water's edge, a luminous lighthouse and the townhall; next to the townhall, a magnificent statue of a tortle. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Local legend tells of the village's humble beginnings with a group of paladins led by a brave tortle. They say the tortle liberated the turtles of unrest to this haven, and their spirits continue to protect the townsfolk. 
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes begin their festivities at the tortle statue, seeking meaning or direction from it's ancient visage. Meanwhile, Varum left to report new findings of the goblins to the mayor.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Arriving at the statue, Torryn believes treasure or answers to reside within.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="torryn" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    Let's knock it over?
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Thinking this to be unwise, Azura urges the two to see if the mayor will allow them to destroy their village's beloved monument. Somewhat reluctantly, the other two follow her to the townhall where they are met with a timid looking human at a desk filing papers, eyes focused behind his round glasses. Strangely, Varum is nowhere to be seen. As our heroes approach, he jolts to a start and our heroes state their case. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before he's able to dismiss his look of bewilderment to respond, another man joins the encounter with a full mane of a hair and beard so untamed it was almost alive. He kindly introduces himself as the mayor, and his assistant was about to begin the opening ceremony for Turtle Fest. Before they are ushered away, Torryn tries his hand to seduce the mayor in order to destroy his statue.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The mayor is smitten. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    But not enough to let them destroy a historical piece of their village and the group is rushed out by the assistant. 
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    The opening ceremony is led with pomp and fanfare as the mayor welcomed everyone who has come from far and wide. Humans, dwarves, and even a few elves have left their seclusion to see the festivities. A rousing opening speech followed by a rough itinerary for the two days were to come. At this point, the afternoon sun is accompanied by a cooling seaside breeze as Turtle Fest begins its long-awaited arrival. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Curious to see these creatures first hand, our heroes charter a boat from the local fishing area. A disgruntled dragonborn lets them take our a rundown dinghy to explore the waters for a steep price. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Upon reaching more open waters, the group catches their first glimpse of a turtle. Deep in the clear waters are majestic creatures that seem to fly gracefully in their aquatic home. Lrrr is instantly captivated and feels compelled to meet one up close. He dives down and touches the mossy shell of one of the larger ones. It's slippery and cool to the touch; this meeting enthralls Lrrr to the point where he almost forgets to breathe. Trying to find the surface, he barely escapes with the mass of his armor weighing him down.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="lrrr" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    I have no regrets!
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Returning to town with new experiences under the belts and a smile upon their faces, our heroes find refuge in the local tavern. Drinks are in hand when a familiar face appears. Varum has also found a moment to relax in the tavern, gingerly sipping his drink. The group catch up when a sailor who's had far more than he can handle knocks into Lrrr before throwing some choice words of disdain at the dwarf. Annoyed for his friend, Torryn throws a punch at the sailor, knocking him over. Shaken and sobered, the sailor dusts himself off and starts to walk away muttering under his breath. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before he can get too far, Torryn has had enough. He grips his spear and takes a lunging step forward, preparing to impale the man from behind.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    But before he is able to pierce the sailor, a sturdy hand grips the spear before Torryn is able to move further.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="varum" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    We do not fight if we do not have to
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Begrudgingly, Torryn watched with irritation as the sailor walked away unharmed. Urging his newfound friends, Lrrr insists they visit the night market and begin their official Turtle Fest experience. Varum bids them farewell as he returns to his drink and a faroff gaze returns to his eyes. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Strolling around, the night market is abuzz with life and activity. Lanterns softly sway on lines strung across rows of local vendors, illuminating the village with little help from the setting sun. Citizens of many walks of life can be seen happily toting around coins and curious to commemorate their experiences. And our heroes are of no exception.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Lrrr found a stand that is selling carved necklaces of wooden turtles. An eager elderly woman from behind the stand graciously accepts a gold piece, a rarity in this village, for five of her finest necklaces. Our heroes thank her and further explore the night market before making their way towards the lighthouse.
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Finding the path towards the lighthouse, the lights and sounds of the night market are a faint echo away; instead, the peaceful glittering waters shine in the glow of the stars and moon. Below the waters are the turtles once again, but this time, a bioluminescent algae has been made apparent on their shells. As the astral stars shine brightly above, so do the marine ones down below. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    At the base of the lighthouse, an attendant welcomes our heroes within and they scale the twisting staircase up to its observation deck. At the top, a few people have found this place to be a haven from the bustle of the night market: a young couple with some scampering children, an old man observing the turtles below, and few others coming and going. Occasionally, the sweep of the lighthouse would cross the beach and shine upon clusters of resting turtles. Seeing the turtles and their nightly glow for the first time, Lrrr has excitement thrust upon him.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="lrrr" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    Turtles! They glow!
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The kids run off to their parents in fear as the thundering dwarf shouts his exclamations. Laughing to himself, Torryn is interrupted by a sight in the corner of his eye. As the lighthouse shines across the beach, a mass of sickly green bodies can be seen dragging a humanoid towards the water. In a moment of strength, Torryn wrenches the luminator from it's track and grips it towards the beach like a spotlight.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    New light reveals a squadron of goblins dragging a blindfolded and gagged man with a full mane of hair towards a boat docked upon the shores. It's the mayor.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes clamber down the lighthouse stairs and sprint towards the bay. Along their way, they run into the assistant and Varum, who're looking for the missing mayor. Torryn informs them of their new findings and Varum has taken off sprinting towards the bay with our heroes struggling to maintain their pace.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    As Varum disappears through the ranks of people unaware of the mayor's peril, our heroes decide to find the boat they chartered earlier to intercept the goblins in the water. With everyone occupied with the festival, finding and launching the boat went seamlessly as they began rowing towards the goblins.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Hearing the rhythmic splashing of another boat's rowing, our heroes pinpoint the goblin's boat and it's headed towards the opposite side of the bay. No further than 30 yards away, a monstrous wake rips through the water's surface with Varum at it's head. The man was swimming through the water almost as fast as the goblins were rowing, and in a single unprecedented moment, he submerged only to reemerge seconds later to fly out of the water and onto the goblin's boat.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    He begins to grab and toss the goblins aside as our heroes watch in awe, but their numbers are too many. They manage to reach the banks before Varum is able to reach the mayor and they rush within a cave. The few goblins who were too occupied with Varum didn't notice that their comrades had left them and instantly ran into the woods in fear of being captured by the hulking man. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes reconvene with Varum and he tells them that he'll stand guard to make sure that they don't receive any unwanted guests during their extraction. Reluctantly, our heroes enter the goblin's domain. 
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Inside, the rocky walls are hewn into a square room. In the center, a single pedestal on which a single circular button rest. Along the rim of the pedestal lay different icons that appear to be weapons, each one no larger than a handprint. In each of the four corners of the room is a golden brazier with charcoalish remains in their centers. On the opposite end, a single metal slab positioned like a door, but with no handle or mechanism. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes explore the edges of the room and discover old murals of paladins fighting off various serpentine beasts, but no means of opening the door. At this point, Torryn pushes the button. Within the ring of weapon icons, a glowingly blue 59 appears near the top of the circle. A second later, a similar 58 appears next to it in clock-wise fashion. Another second, a 57 appears following the same pattern. Our heroes are thrown into disarray and panic until they push the button again. The numbers disappear until another 59 appears where it was before and the countdown began anew.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Upon reaching 45, the brazier in the upper right corner burst with flames, relighting it's coals. Simultaneously, the numbers began to glow a bright green as it ticked down to 44, then 43, and 42. Torryn pushes the button again. The numbers disappear and the brazier extinguishes.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Caught between tension and curiosity, the group frantically hits the button several times, sometimes letting it drop a few seconds before pushing it again. Realizing their actions are leading them nowhere, our heroes allow it to count down.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    59. 58. 57. Each number brilliantly blue. 47. 46. 45. The brazier lights aflame, each number now a shining green. 32. 31. 30. Another brazier, now in the lower right corner, comes alive with fire. The numbers turn into a hot orange color. 17, 16, 15. The lower left brazier is lit just like the ones before, now the numbers are a blazingly hot red. 10. 9. 8. Our heroes are gripped by the tension of the unknown. 7. 6. 5. The numbers glow a blindngly white, the final brazier is breathed into life with new flame. 4. 3. 2. The numbers are flashing wildly in the same white glow and the braziers' flames grow ever taller. 1. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The flames simmer down to a manageable size and the numbers give way to a sunken gray color. With a grating squeal, the metal slab slides apart and our heroes look at each other in amazement before continuing onto the next room.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The following area had tables strewn about and a few cooking pits dispersed amongst them. It seemed to be largely inhabited. To the left, right, and straight ahead appear more doors. Testing each of them, the ones to the left and right were locked. Picking the one on the left was fruitless, but the one on the right gave way to a storage area filled with crates.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Within lay several treasures, presumably from the paladins that used to inhabit these quarters long ago. Inside some of the crates, Lrrr found an ornate yet sturdy spear and Torryn found a crate that seemed to rise and fall as if it were breathing. As he moved closer to touch it, it sprang alive and held him tight. A mimic. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The following battle ended as quickly as it started, and the mimic lay motionless as Azura dropped several crossbow bolts into its rough exterior. Exiting the room with some newfound items, the group began to move towards the area left unexplored.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    While this room looked mostly bare, a single figure stood across the way in front of another passage. A hobgoblin with arms folded and a look of disdain towards our heroes. First to act, Azura quickly tries to tell the hobgoblin their intentions via undercommon.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="azura" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    We just want to rescue the mayor, we wish you no harm!
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Curiously, the hobgoblin replies that there must be a misunderstanding. In regular common. Before more words can be exchanged, several goblins run fleeing from behind the opening behind the hobgoblin and he quickly turns around to see the commotion. Panic fills his eyes and he motions for our heroes to follow him. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The following area is much larger than the previous ones, perhaps twice the size. A small channel runs into the room and runs along the edge before wrapping around and exiting near where it came from. Several pillars uphold the ceiling and a large throne sits at the opposite end. However, in front of the throne is the mayor with a crazed look in his eye and a dead goblin in his hands. At his feet rests a summoning circle with arcane glyphs etched around the sides. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before anyone can act, he yells an ancient phrase and dark energies swirl from the circle. Fog begins to rise from within the spell and it manifests itself into a huge basilisk that occupies a space larger than a small house. Instinctively, our heroes rush into action, throwing away any previous thoughts they had about the mayor. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The hobgoblin tries to strike at the basilisk with his short sword, but each attack is deflected by it's toughened scales. Torryn with his greatsword is met with better luck as his finds better footing and is able to plunge his sword deep within the beast's flesh. In retaliation, the basilisk attempts to petrify all those who look at it, but no to avail as everyone is able to avert their eyes in the nick of time. As the mayor slings spells at our heroes, Azura is unfortunately struck is brought to critical levels. Trying to muster some strength, she returns with an attack of her own, landing squarely on the mayor's chest taking him out of commission. Lrrr is able to use his experiences in the military to help rally and coordinate his teammembers closer to victory. A tail swipe from the basilisk leaves Torryn and the hobgoblin reeling, but Torryn is able to quickly readjust himself and claw his way up the basilisk's neck. With a bellow that reaches the heavens, he jumps off but not before swinging his blade through the basilisk's head, and severing it from it's body. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The hobgoblin thanks them for their assistance and that he has a lot to tell them. But first, he shows them to a small sleeping quarter and they rest for the night.
