  <div class="hideme">
    Walking over to the fallen basilisk and mayor, our heroes inspect their foes. Torryn retrieves a fang from the basilisk, and Lrrr takes a handful of the mayor's hair as well as an amulet. Satisfied with their trophies, the hobgoblin leads them towards a place to rest for the night. But along the way, Azura raises the question:
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="azura" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    But wait, where's Varum?
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Curiously, the valiant stalwart made no appearance during the entire encounter. Paying no mind to this the hobgoblin began to suade the adventurers to his side. He explained how the mayor was truly evil, and his clan of goblins were seeking to liberate the village from the clutches of the manipulative mayor. The gift of the turtle population has been exploited by the mayor for nefarious deeds: contraband and illegal harvesting.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The goblins began with civility, trying to approach the town with reasoning and fair play, but it led to no avail. They were chased away, sometimes violently, by the townspeople and their predisposition towards their kind; perhaps even by the psychic coaxings of the mayor himself. That's when they resorted to raids. Raids to deter the tourists from ever coming near Turtle Fest and to drain the town of it's resources to flush the mayor out.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Walking through the goblin base, our heroes walk backwards through the rooms until they reach the one door previously locked. The hobgoblin leads them in after inserting the key and within the further recesses of the room lay a huddled mass of goblins and their young, quivering in fear. He comforts them and assures that our heroes will not harm them, but contrarily are here to protect and speak for them. For tomorrow, they will be able to walk in the light of day without fear of the townspeople.  
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>


  <div class="hideme">
    Come morning, our heroes wake up to the hobgoblin staring intently at them. Claiming to be guarding them, he ensures it was for their own safety. Torryn is unsettled by this. Regardless, the team shakes it off and embarks the new day feeling refreshed with new goals in mind: reclaim Turtle Bay.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Upon exiting the goblin lair, the team revists Varum's absence. Scanning the ground, they notice signs of a struggle. Several small footprints are seen swarming another set of much larger and much deeper set of footprints. However, as the struggled seemed to stray further from the base, the smaller footprints dissipated as the larger ones took off in stride. Our heroes and the hobgoblin in tow followed Varum's footprints with earnest as it led to their original path back to Turtle Bay.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    All seemed calm, especially with the Hobgoblin warding off any other goblins that were looking to raid unsuspecting travellers. Eventually, they made their way back to the village without any issue. Waiting for them at the entrance was Varum himself. Quick to draw arms, Varum settled down as our heroes explained the hobgoblin and their situation. Varum claimed he returned to Turtle Bay after escaping the goblin attack outside their lair and quickly apologizes to the hobgoblin for any damages to his people. Gracious and understanding, the hobgoblin accepts and urges the crew to gather the townsfolk to make an announcement.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Arriving at the town's center, Torryn bellows for the crowd's attention. A hush fell upon the crowd, and a mixed group of looks ranging from disdainful to fearing spread throughout.      
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    As the hobgoblin told his tale of the turtles, it seemed as though the mayor's grasp on their minds seemed to loosen and unbind. More and more people gathered around and the news spread through the town like wildfire. Before too long, the mayor's assistant arrives and restores order to the town. As their secondary leader and perhaps the individual who was within the tighest of the mayor's grasps, the assistant advised the public to resume the events of Turtle Fest while he consults the hobgoblin.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Our heroes, as a group to never turn down an opportunity for fun, decided it was time for some well deserved relaxation.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    By this time, the festivities have reached full swing. Various booths and activities are strewn around the common areas of Turtle Bay. Festive music from travelling bards sway through air, scents and tastes of freshly baked goods enthrall the senses, and the removal of the mayor seemed to have even made the atmosphere of the festival more authentic and genuine. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Eyeing a test of strength, Torryn swaggers to the attendant. He's offered a chance to win a prize if he can successfully ring the bell at the top of the lever system with a hammer and rail. Seeing this to be a simple challenge, Torryn grips the toy mallet with two of his hands, plants his feet firmly on the ground either side of the target, and focuses his power throughout his body to slam the hammer onto the lever.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The piece of metal shot up along the rails, rang the bell, and continued through the bell destroying it. A sheepish smile from Torryn and a shrug is retaliated with a mixture of disbelief and a scowl from the attendant. As a result, he awards Torryn with a turtle egg with yellow splotches, which was specially crafted and painted for the festival. Our heroes learned that with each activity comes a prize, and each prize is ranked from green to yellow to purple. The attendent reluctantly tells them that the better the egg, the better the prize; and a select few will even win the opportunity to receive the Blessing of the Tortle.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Lrrr spots an eating contest and hurridly rushes over. Torryn follows suit as well as Azura. After the attendant began their round, Lrrr begins to choke on his food and Azura surprisingly devours her plate with fervor. Torryn, although a vigorous eater, took 3rd place behind a local child. For their efforts, Azura, Torryn, and Lrrr were provided with a purple egg and two green eggs respectively. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Azura, riding the coattails of her victory, strolls towards a bottle throwing booth. A series of metallic bottles stacked in a pyramid stand trial towards a single ball thrown by a participant. Azura confidently acknowledges the attendant and firmly grips the ball. Her vision focuses on the bottles and with strength channeled up her body and released from her fingertips, the ball is sent straight through the air. It lands pitifully against the canvas backing and the bottles stay standing where they as mockingly possible for an inanimate object. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before she can lament further, Lrrr notices an arena for honorable combat. A jousting arena, two parallel lanes where particpants mount a steed dressed as turtles and try to topple each other at speed. But these steeds were merely volunteers, the noble lances are made of soft and pliable material, and it appears as though this attraction is meant for a younger crowd. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Lrrr, nevertheless, stands patiently in line at one side of the arena. Growing impatient, he attempts to intimidate the two patrons in front of him and they flee. Unbeknownst to him, they instead run from the sight of Torryn with a much more menacing demeanor behind him. Gleeful with his advancement, he is up next and is shown the ropes to the attraction. While no one is looking, he swaps his foam lance for the spear he found previously. The volunteers were unpaid and thus, did not care. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Mounting his "steed", Lrrr looked at the end of the lane hungrily for his opponent. To his surprise, Varum was there, struggling to maintain his balance on the smaller volunteer.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before long, the two steeds situated themselves and began to jog as fast as their legs could muster with a goliath of a man on one and a heaping dwarf on the other. As Lrrr approached Varum, he extended his spear and positioned himself behind his shield. Varum acted similarly, lowering his shield to match the spear and positioning his lance accordingly. Nearing each other, Lrrr gave his spear a hefty thrust and it penetrated through Varum's shield, but the sentinel was not to be deterred. A smile on his face and a glimmer in his eye was quickly followed by a tug on the spear so forcefull that Lrrr was veritably removed from his steed who was gasping for breath.  
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme"><div class="quote"><div class="varum" style="text-align: center; width:100%">
    Good match, my friend! Very tricky, haha!
  </div></div></div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Dumbfounded, Lrrr just looks at Varum with confusion as to how he was able to perform such a manuever. Varum just smiles a knowing a smile as the attendant provides them them a green egg and a yellow egg. As Lrrr collects himself, Varum points over to the bay and suggests our heroes try their hand at the boat race: an adventerous test of speed and fortitude. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    He explains that the contestants must create their own boat and row around the bay until they circle back towards the beginning. It is also the pinnacle of all the Turtle Fest activities and is long awaited by everyone within and without the village. At the moment, a few teams can be seen constructing their boats along the beach as a few turtles watch curiously. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Seeking glory in naval racing, our heroes set to work. Lrrr begins to harvest wood for the boat while Torryn and Azura discuss plans for construction. Within the hour, a small boat was constructed and Varum gave it a thumbs up of approval. While they were building their vessel, Varum had helped them enroll in the line up. Now it was only a matter of time before the race begins, so the group rests and relaxes on the beach.
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
  . . .
  </div><br>


  <div class="hideme">
     During their relaxation, Torryn felt the desire to encounter a turtle up close and personal, just as Lrrr did. He approached one near him on the beach, but was stopped by a green dragonborn gaurd. Being informed that the turtles are not to be interacted with, Torryn attempts to intimidate the gaurd with an electrically charged growl. Looking down at Torryn, this gaurd was not to be outdone; he emmitted a dark bile that bubbled from his clenched jaws. Dripping onto the sand, it sizzled and evaporated. Once again, he ordered Torryn to return to his boat.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
     Luckily, the race was about to start and Torryn dismissed the thought of the gaurd. Pushing their boat to the startng area, Lrrr, Azura, and Torryn readied themselves before the the officiator began the race. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    A quick countdown led to a a magical starting bang and the racers were off. Within moments, one of the boats was already throwing spears at our heroes boat. In retaliation, Azura casts darkness around a wide area, consuming several boats and the spears stop coming. Lrrr and Torryn row with all of their might when another attack is made from a boat in behind of them.  One of the teams caught in the darkness emerged and is taking a momentary lapse in rowing to lob more spears towards their boat. Unleashing his anger from earlier, Torryn's teeth crackle with electric energy and a streak of lightning is blasted near their boat. Arcing across the surface, the boat is decimated and the surrounding teams are also charged with the energy before lifeguards take to the water. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    With all three of our heroes rowing, they begin gaining on the boat ahead of them. About one third of the way through the course, they've traversed the southern section of the bay and are now moving north along the western bend. One boat ahead of them, another one quickly gaining behind them. Behind that team, a swathe of electrified contests upset that their chances have just been washed ashore. For good measure, Azura casts an illusion in the water to deter more teams from coming towards them. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Before our heroes can react, a spear hurtles from above and breaks through the bottom hull of the boat, instantly creating a leak. Quickly reacting, Azura casts mending on the hole and hands the spear to Torryn who launches it back towards their assailants. On its return flight, it lands with a splash in the water, not quite striking its target. As soon as Torryn had let go of the spear, two more holes appeared in the sides of their ship, the team behind them had begun throwing their spears as well. Enraged, Torryn throws both spears back towards their origin. The spears whistle through the air and one finds the hull of the opponents ship whereas the other found the hull of the opponent himself. Crying out for a medic, the team is left behind as our heroes begin rowing with all of their strength.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Gaining distance, the two remaining boats had just passed the goblin hideout on the northern end of the bay at two thirds of the way through the course. At the corner of the eyes, any racer would be able to see cheering goblins alongside humans on the shore; however, they were both too occupied with the competition. Torryn with two remaining spears throws one of them, but as it's on course to tear through the opposing boat, they sacrified one of their own spears to knock it out of the air. Determining that they need to get closer, Torryn helps the other two row; as soon as they get within striking range, Torryn uses his greatsword to smash the wood himself. Rocked by the rowing and the waves, Torryn misses both of his attempts and the other team begins to close the distance from the finish line. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Holding the final spear in hand, Torryn closes his eyes in focus. Feeling the wind as they progress towards the ever encroaching end and hearing the hurried splashing of the oars, he zones in on the escaping boat. He launches the spear and it stalls in the air as time seems to slow down. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    It crashes into through the enemy boat with a splintering hole that incapacitates the entire vessel, and our heroes cruise through the finish line victorious. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Back on the beach, Varum gives another of his hearty laughs as the setting sun gleamed on his face and commends them for their quick thinking and victory. This contrasted with the glaring looks from competitors who've trained all year for another chance of winning the Turtle Bay Race. Heeding not to these conquered opponents, our heroes graciously accept golden egg turtles from the race officiator. 
  </div><br>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 4em">
    . . .
  </div><br>

  <div class="hideme">
    Hours pass before our heroes are invited by the assistant to the grand feast before the Blessing of the Tortle in honor of them liberating the town from the mayor's grasp. Leading them to the common area in front of the town hall, the assistant introduced a fine spread is laid out for the town and our heroes to enjoy before retreating inside. Exotic meats sizzling from the fire, fresh produce from the mainland, and even a few dwarven drinks were making their rounds. Seated on a raised platform were the heroes as they had a full view of the long rows of tables in the common area. All were merry and thankful for another exciting year of the Turtle Festival. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    From the townhall, the assistant reemerged with the Hobgoblin and they came bearing gifts for the group. Among the gold, the assistant presented a diadem, known as Fortuna's Diadem, and it was once told to be worn by one of the paladins that helped settle this land. From the hobgoblin, a decanter. He explained that it's a decanter of endless water, just say the word and a gallon of water will instantly pour out. He says that he wasn't able to find anyone to do it in town, but those far stronger than he would be able to enhance the amulet. 
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Accepting these gifts, our heroes resumed the feast before a bell tolled to signal the Blessing of the Tortle would begin.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    The assistant excused himself to prepare for the blessing, and as he does so, everyone's eggs began to hatch. From the green and yellow eggs came trinkets or gold. The purple ones had common potions. But the gold ones contained tokens to indicate guaranteed recipients of the Blessing. Occasionally, a purple egg would hatch a token, and rarer so a yellow one, until about two dozen people had come forth with their tokens. With our heroes among them, they were taken within the town hall and into a courtyard within. The newly darkening sky visible above and a stone wall running around the square. At the far end, a small stage where the assistant was standing in formal looking robes. A line of tall fire-lamps are dotted along a path that came close to the perimeter of the wall.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    Amid the crowd of blessing recipients, our heroes could see representatives from several walks of life: A copper-dragonborn eyeing the guards that dripped with his condescending manner, a proud-looking elf that appeared to have a mission on her mind and a soft smile on her lips, the gentle necklace seller from the marketplace, and in the back a familiar face with an even more familiar moustache. Varum catches up to our heroes and exclaims at their luck before the assistant hushes everyone to receive the blessing.
  </div><br>
  <div class="hideme">
    He begins the ceremony but before he is able to get past his first sentence, the lights extinguish. The few mages they have hurridly try to relight the flames only to find that once the light is reestablished, the assistant is on the ground with a dagger's hilt sticking out of his abdomen.
